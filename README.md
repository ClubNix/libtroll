|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1: Cosmetic       | This is only a visual improvement of the entire system, nothing dangerous theoretically.         |
| 2: Weird          | You may notice a change a behavior in your program. If a program crashes, this is not our fault. |

| 5: Nuke.sh        | If your entire system is crashing, this is the kernel's fault.                                   |
